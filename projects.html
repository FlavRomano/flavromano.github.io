    <h5>Programming languages</h5>
    <p>I quite enjoy programming in C and Python, in my spare time I have learned enough Golang and have taken college
      courses on C, OCaml, Java and JavaScript (also TypeScript). The latter two are not really my favorites, I'm not a
      very OOP guy, but
      I'll definitely cherish them someday.

    <h5>Projects</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/FlavRomano/BigFarmLabII">BigFarm</a></strong>. The final project of the
        C course I took in 2021. It's a client-server application with a multithreaded farm, this was my first
        approach to sockets. <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/FlavRomano/WordleClientServer">Wordle Client-Server</a></strong>. My java
        networking lab final project, is a client-server graphical cli application on which you can play the famous game
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle">Wordle</a>. To play you have to register and log in, the server
        manages a database of users (that persistently maintains users' data) in the form of Json and also a small
        social network where you can post your games, allowing users to share their results. <br> [PRIVATE AT THE MOMENT

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/FlavRomano/pomodoro-telegram-bot">Pomodoro Timer</a></strong>. Small and
        awkward project I wrote during my first year of CS, I barely knew how to write "Hello world" in python and
        what an API was. Nevertheless, I wanted to get my hands on something and this project open my mind a lot.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/FlavRomano/gosimplex">GoSimplex</a></strong>. Written while in
        Operations
        Research class the professor was explaining the Simplex Algorithm. At that time I was
        learning Golang on my own, so I decided to try to implement it with a Numpy-like library. It sucks but as an
        exercise it wasn't bad, especially reading various documentation of things completely new to me.
